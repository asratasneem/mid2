**Title:** RNA to DNA Reverse Transcription and Nucleotide Analysis

**Author:** Asra Tasneem Shaik

**Date:** 03-20-2024

**Programming Language & Version:** Python 3.12

**Dependencies:**
None

**Input:**
Two FASTA files containing RNA sequences (`RNA-sequence1.fna` and `RNA-sequence2.fna`).

**Short Script Description:**
This Python script performs reverse transcription of RNA sequences into DNA sequences and computes the frequencies of nucleotides, dinucleotides, and trinucleotides in the original RNA sequences. It then compares the differences in percentage abundance of dinucleotides and trinucleotides between two provided RNA sequences.

**Output Files:**
None. The script prints the nucleotide frequencies, dinucleotide frequencies, trinucleotide frequencies, and any differences in percentage abundance to the console.
